## Installation

You can install the development version of rpc from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("laijasmine/rpc")
```

## Update Class Information Example

```{r example}
#rpc::create_class("2025-09-15", 9)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
